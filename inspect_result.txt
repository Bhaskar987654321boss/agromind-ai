--- Model Input Details ---
Expected Input Shape: (None, 256, 256, 3)
Testing with dummy image of size: 256x256
Black Image Prediction: Index 0, Confidence 0.5506
White Image Prediction: Index 2, Confidence 1.0000
Random Noise Prediction: Index 1, Confidence 1.0000

If all predictions are the same (e.g., Index 1), the model might be biased or expecting different preprocessing.
